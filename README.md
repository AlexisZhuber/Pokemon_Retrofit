Http_project
Overview
Http_project is a modern Android application designed to fetch and display detailed Pokémon information using PokeAPI. This implementation relies on HttpURLConnection for network calls and org.json for manual JSON parsing. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and leverages Jetpack Compose with Material3 for a sleek, responsive UI.
